I"¥	<p>Iâ€™m James. I use computers to explore biology.</p>

<h1 id="more-information">More Information</h1>

<p>I am a bioinformatician that examines protein sequences and structures.
Currently I am working on the functional effects of variants on transmembrane proteins and how mutations may or may not lead to disease.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL-EBI.</li>
  <li>PhD at the University of Manchester in conjunction with the Singapore A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute.</li>
  <li>Masters in Biochemistry at the University of Liverpool.</li>
</ul>

<p>My publications can be viewed on <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hbR8DVYAAAAJ&amp;hl=en">Google Scholar</a>.
Particularly, I have found myself studying transmembrane proteins in the context of structure and disease.</p>

<p>Occasionally I will write a little bit of a summary or discussion here if I come across any impactful or interesting articles from academic journals.
These are often not on my area of academic expertise, but they will usually have a focus on the life sciences.
If you want to give me some recommended reading, have a correction, or want to get involved in some way or share your thoughts with me, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.</p>
