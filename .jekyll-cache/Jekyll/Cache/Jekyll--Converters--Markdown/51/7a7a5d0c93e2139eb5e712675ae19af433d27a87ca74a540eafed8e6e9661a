<p>I recently answered a question on <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/a/87770/3553">Bio.SE</a> regarding the medical case of a French man called Tarrare who was alive in the revolution.
The case has achieved near-legendary status due to the fantastic accounts of his showmanship, his seemingly insatiable hunger, his botched attempt at espionage, and his tragic descent into cannibalism.</p>
