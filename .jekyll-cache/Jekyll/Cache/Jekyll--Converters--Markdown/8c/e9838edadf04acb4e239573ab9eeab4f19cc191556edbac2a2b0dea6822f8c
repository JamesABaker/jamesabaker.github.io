<p>Nicola Davis of the Guardian opens her interview of Robbert Dijkraaf with <a href="https://soundcloud.com/guardianscienceweekly/cross-section-robbert">an antiquated recording from a Johns Hopkins review</a>.
The voice we hear describes a thought-provoking anecdote.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I was showing a friend of mine through one of the laboratories at Johns Hopkins University, where he was talking with a research scientist.</p>

  <p>He said â€œThis is all very wonderful.
But, what does it mean? What value has it? How can you use it?â€</p>

  <p>The scientist said â€œI donâ€™t know.
Iâ€™m just looking for some answers.â€</p>
