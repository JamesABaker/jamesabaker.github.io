<p>A while ago I saw <a href="https://biology.stackexchange.com/questions/23074/what-are-the-side-effects-of-long-term-liquid-breathing/27905#27905">a question on the Biology Stack Exchange Network</a>.
‚ÄúWhat are the side-effects of long-term liquid breathing?‚Äù
This is a topic that has long interested me, so I decided to post an answer.
Over time the answer grew in size and depth.
It now reads more as a stand alone piece rather than the quick Q&amp;A summary answer it is supposed to be.</p>
