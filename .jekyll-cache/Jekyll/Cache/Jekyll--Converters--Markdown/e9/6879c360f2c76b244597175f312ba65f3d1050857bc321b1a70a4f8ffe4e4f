<p>“<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor">Impact Factor</a>” (IF) is a term that aims to do what it says on the tin; it’s a rating of the impact of an article.
But it is more than just a number for an individual article.
IF is used to determine an academic’s success in a given job position, their right to a grant or future job, and on a more day-to-day level it gives them bragging rights.
In a quest to increase the IF of a paper, researchers often aim to get their work published in journals that are not always the most appropriate.
Instead, they would rather publish in a journal with the highest IF that will consider their paper.</p>
