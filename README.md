## Job history

I have worked as a bioinformatician and data scientist that examines large biological and health datasets.
 - Modelling Lead at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) 
 - Senior Analyst at the Joint Biosecurity Centre, part of NHS test and trace.

## Out of the lab

 - I have engaged with the general public and schools about science.
	- Featured in the Sanger blog post on ["Inspiring prisoners and their families with genomics"](https://sangerinstitute.blog/2020/08/25/inspiring-prisoners-and-their-families-with-genomics/).
    - I was awarded a grant from the Enabling Fund from the Wellcome Trust to run a workshop in schools and public events for using video games to examine protein structures.
