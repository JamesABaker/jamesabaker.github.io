# Explain Amenhotep III the magnificent
Wealthy
Large armies
Treatises with Nubians and north eastern
Many gods
Rules 1386 to 1349 as the 9th Pharaoh of the 18th dynasty in the New Kingdom
KV35 discovered in 1898 by Victor Loret. Not the original tomb.

# Akhenaten the heretic King
Previously known as Amenhotep IV
Ruled 1370-1354
Year 1: Worships only sun gods in Luxor
Year 3: Sundisk god introduced
Year 5: Name change
Year 8: Moved from Memphis and Thebes to Amarna in middle Egypt
Year 9: Erased the old gods and polytheism
Year 17: he dies at the age of 40-50
Realigns the Pharoah to the role of god-king
Feminine physical traits
Only had daughters

# Tutankhamun the boy king
Discovered in 1922 by Howard Carter
One of the greatest hoards ever discovered intact.
Seven year search to find KV62

Ruled 9-10 years c. 1332–1323 BC
18-19 at point of death
Heavily advised
Destroyed any reference to Akhenaten as much as possible
Changed name from Tutankhaten
Moved back to Luxor and Thebes as capitals
No mention of mother
Wife is KV21A, Ankhesenamun
Last of Pharoah of the dynasty

# The mummies
# KV62
KV62 had a coffin referencing Tiye with a lock of hair
Also had 2 small mummified fetuses.  Possibly the children of the Pharoah
One of at least 7 months.
One much smaller


#The elder and younger lady
KV35 (Amenhotep III site) was in the Valley of the kings (Thebes) by Victor Loret
KV35EL  and KV35YL found along with a small boy in antechamber.
Unidentified
Damaged by tomb raiders
KV35YL originally identified as male, later identified as female by Dr. Grafton Elliot Smith.

#KV55
KV55 was discovered by Edward R. Ayrton for Theodore M. Davis in 1907 in the valley of the kings
Desecrated tomb, cartouches chiseled off
Poorly documented original excavation
Based on x-ray and skeletal examination, the age of the mummy at death was 20-25 with one estimate of 35.
In the tomb are references to Akhenaten and Tiye, however this is not likely to be the original tomb
Tiye was said to be buried with her husband at a different site
Akhenaten was certainly buried in Armana in the tomb he was preparing

# DNA fingerprinting
15 mummies analysed, 4 of which were controls
3 mummies from KV62, 2 of which fetuses
KV35:
Amenhotep III
KV35YL
KV35EL


Microsatellite markers where n shows reiteration of repeat motifs (STRs) in non-coding regions of nuclear DNA

DNA from KV35EL is the daughter of well documented Thuya and Yuya (not shown)
KV35EL and Amenhotep III are the mother and father of KV55 and KV35YL; KV55 is probably Akenaten (macthes historical record) not be Smenkhkare or Neferneferuaten
KV55 and KV35EL are siblings
KV35YL does not match anyone from the historic record; Nefertiti is not a named sister.
KV35YL is Tutankhamun’s mother
Amenhotep III, KV55, and Tutankhamun show that they were descended respectively

# MRI pathology of Akhenaten and Tutankhamun
Radiology of Tutankhamun:
Ruled out gynecomastia, craniosynostoses, Antley-Bixler syndrome or deficiency in cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, Marfan syndrome, or related disorders
Left foot shows bone necrosis and club foot (Freiburg-Köhler syndrome). Canes found in tomb.

P. falciparum STEVOR gene family DNA found. Marlaria present at time of death

KV55 is missing the chest and has a fragmented pelvic region and Tutankhamun is missing the pelvic region, so putative breast analysis for gynecomastia or Marfan syndrome  cannot be determined.
Marfan syndrome has been ruled out however as there is no valid combination of major/minor symptoms
The femininity is possibly an artistic style, not an anatomical record

# Hawass letters to the editor

Hawass himself: FBI use >10 hit repeat motifs to match. aDNA is harder to acquire so standard dropped to 8. This is still 99.99% accurate.

Eline Lorenzen, Natural History Museum of Denmark
Contamination highly likely prior to Cairo’s handling
Long term survival of aDNA unlikely in mitochondria, let alone nuclear aDNA as used in the Hawass study. Unprecedented, unverified method of aDNA analysis.

Brenda J. Baker, Arizona State University
The discoverer of KV55 Sir Grafton Elliot Smith observed bone fusion to deduce age at 25-26. Macroscopic radiographic examination of bone fusion by anatomists Ronald Harrison and Ahmed le Batrawi concluded the age of 20 in 1963. Phase 1 Suchey-Brooks system (osteologist common ageing method) is 95% accurate for between 15-23 years old
Everyone else agrees KV55 is too young to be Akhenaten

James G. Gamble, Stanford University Medical Center
Symptoms are categorically not consistent with clubfoot diagnosis


Irwin Braveman, Yale Medical School
Generally inconsistent and unsubstantiated claims
Skull shapes appear to be deformed by eye despite cephalic index within the normal range
With the aDNA integrity claimed, disease markers could be tested for diseases such as deficiency in cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase, which normally requires molecular tests for diagnosis
Study still does not rule out Antley-Bixler syndrome caused by a single diseased gene and causes estrogen production

Christian Timmann, Bernhard Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine
Foot disorders explained by SCD, present in 9-22% of population
Malaria is fatal to young children, not semi-immune adults of 18-19
Gene testing could identify if HbS is SCD
