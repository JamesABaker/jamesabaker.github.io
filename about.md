I'm James. I use computers to explore biology.

### More Information

I'm a researcher in the Thornton Group at EMBL-EBI. I am a bioinformatician that examines protein sequences and structures. Currently I am working on the functional effects of variants on transmembrane proteins and how such mutations may or may not lead to disease.

Occasionally I will write a little bit of a summary or discussion here if I come across any impactful or interesting articles from academic journals.
Usually, these will have a focus on the life sciences.
If you want to give me some recommended reading, or want to get involved in some way or share your thoughts with me, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.
