I'm James. I use computers to explore biology.

### Academia

My publications can be viewed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hbR8DVYAAAAJ&hl=en).
I have found myself studying transmembrane proteins in the context of structure and disease.

I am a bioinformatician that examines protein sequences and structures.
Currently I am working on the functional effects of variants on transmembrane proteins and how different mutations may or may not lead to disease.
 - Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL-EBI.
 - PhD at the University of Manchester in conjunction with the Singapore A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute.
 - Masters in Biochemistry at the University of Liverpool.
 - Intern in the Computational Chemistry Department at the Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.

### Out of the lab

 - I am an active [STEM ambassador](https://www.stem.org.uk/stem-ambassadors) that engages with the general public and schools regularly.
 If you are interested in arranging a visit, don't hesitate to get in touch.
    - I have been awarded a grant from the Enabling Fund from the Wellcome Trust to run a workshop in schools and public events for using video games to examine protein structures.

 - You can see my Q&A posting history at [Biology.SE](https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3553/james).
My top tags are biochemistry, bioinformatics, proteins, and the cell membrane.

 - I attend and help to run the [cancer journal club](https://github.com/jurgjn/jc/blob/master/SCHEDULE.md) at the EBI.

 - I occasionally [tweet](https://twitter.com/JamesBaker_biol).

### The journal club on this website

Occasionally I will write a little bit of a summary or discussion here if I come across impactful or interesting articles from academic journals.
These are often not on my area of academic expertise, but they will usually have a focus on the life sciences.

All the code, posts, and draft posts are available on â€‹[GitHub](https://github.com/JamesABaker/jamesabaker.github.io).
