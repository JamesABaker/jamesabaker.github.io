I'm James. I use computers to explore biology.

### More Information

I'm a researcher in the Thornton Group at EMBL-EBI. I am a bioinformatician that examines protein sequences and structures. Currently I am working on the functional effects of variants on transmembrane proteins and how mutations may or may not lead to disease.

Previously, I completed my Masters in Biochemistry at the University of Liverpool, and my PhD from the University of Manchester and Singapore A*STAR institute.

My publications can be viewed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hbR8DVYAAAAJ&hl=en).
My area of expertise is predicting the function of cryptic protein signals using bioinformatic methods such as advanced statistics, biochemical and biophysical modelling, and large-scale data analysis.
Particularly, I have found myself studying transmembrane proteins.

### This site

Occasionally I will write a little bit of a summary or discussion here if I come across any impactful or interesting articles from academic journals.
These are often not on my area of academic expertise, but they will usually have a focus on the life sciences.
If you want to give me some recommended reading, have a correction, or want to get involved in some way or share your thoughts with me, please donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.
