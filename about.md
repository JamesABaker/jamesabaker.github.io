I'm James. I use computers to explore biology.

# More Information

I am a bioinformatician that examines protein sequences and structures. Currently I am working on the functional effects of variants on transmembrane proteins and how mutations may or may not lead to disease.
 - Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL-EBI.
 - PhD at the University of Manchester in conjunction with the Singapore A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute.
 - Masters in Biochemistry at the University of Liverpool.

My publications can be viewed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hbR8DVYAAAAJ&hl=en).
Particularly, I have found myself studying transmembrane proteins in the context of structure and disease.

## This site

Occasionally I will write a little bit of a summary or discussion here if I come across any impactful or interesting articles from academic journals.
These are often not on my area of academic expertise, but they will usually have a focus on the life sciences.
If you want to give me some recommended reading, have a correction, or want to get involved in some way or share your thoughts with me, please don’t hesitate to contact me.

All the code, posts, and draft posts are available on ​[GitHub](https://github.com/JamesABaker/jamesabaker.github.io).
