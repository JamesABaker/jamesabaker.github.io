I'm James. I use computers to explore biology.

### More Information

Here I aim to explore impactful articles from academic journals, usually with a focus on the life sciences. However, I like seeing a two way dialogue. If you want to get involved in some way or share your thoughts with me, please don’t hesitate to contact me.
