I'm James. I use computers to explore biology. ðŸ’»ðŸ§¬ He/Him

### Tiny CV

My publications can be viewed on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=hbR8DVYAAAAJ&hl=en).
I have found myself studying transmembrane proteins in the context of structure and disease.

I have worked as a bioinformatician and data scientist that examines large biological and health datasets.
 - Modelling Lead at the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) 
 - Research Analyst at Joint Biosecurity Centre, part of NHS test and trace.
 - Postdoctoral Fellow at EMBL-EBI.
 - PhD at the University of Manchester in conjunction with the Singapore A*STAR Bioinformatics Institute.
 - Masters in Biochemistry at the University of Liverpool.
 - Intern in the Computational Chemistry Department at the Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok.

### Out of the lab

 - I have engaged with the general public and schools about science.
	- Featured in the Sanger blog post on ["Inspiring prisoners and their families with genomics"](https://sangerinstitute.blog/2020/08/25/inspiring-prisoners-and-their-families-with-genomics/).
    - I have been awarded a grant from the Enabling Fund from the Wellcome Trust to run a workshop in schools and public events for using video games to examine protein structures.

 - You can see my Q&A posting history at [Biology Stack Exchange](https://biology.stackexchange.com/users/3553/james).
My top tags are biochemistry, bioinformatics, proteins, and the cell membrane.
